    Name: "Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon (and the “Diamond Beach”)",
    Desc:"The lagoon is the deepest found in Iceland carved out by the river and its feeding glacier. The multi-colored icebergs break of Breidamerkurjokull, to the drop into the lagoon only to keep floating around until they reach the black beach below. Once they have made it to the beach the icebergs are much smaller. This is where most spent their last moments before being united with the Atlantic ocean. This black sand beach where they melt away is therefore often called the Diamond Beach. "
